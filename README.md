An extension to kickstart a react project as quickly as possible!
## Motivation & Features
As a developer who works extensively with React, I often found myself needing to perform tasks that are time consuming and repetitive. This led me to create the React Speedrun Tools extension for VS code, which includes features like removing the boilerplate code made using CRA, creating components or adding new fonts.
## Installation
1.  Open VS Code
2.  Press Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + X to open the Extensions panel
3.  Search for "React Speedrun Tools" and click on install.
## Usage
1.  Open a React project
2.  Open the Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P)
3.  Select one of the available commands and follow the prompts to complete the command
## Future Prospects
I plan to continue improving the React Tools extension and adding new features as needed. Some potential features that I'm considering include:

- Support for additional file types, like typescript
- Add a react router generator
- Make the extension work for non-sass users

If you have any feedback or suggestions for new features, please don't hesitate to let me know. I'm always looking for ways to improve the React Tools extension and make it more useful for developers like you.
